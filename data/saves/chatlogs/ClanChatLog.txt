[7/14/20 09:00AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Banaan: so its bis?	
[7/14/20 09:01AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: bye flub	
[7/14/20 09:01AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: I dunno banaan	
[7/14/20 09:01AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: It might be, but haven't compared it to 500m cape yet	
[7/14/20 09:01AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: Or completionist	
[7/14/20 09:02AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Banaan: 500m cape?	
[7/14/20 09:02AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: 500m exp in one skill cape	
[7/14/20 09:02AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Banaan: ah	
[7/14/20 09:02AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: Yeah	
[7/14/20 09:02AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Banaan: well getting 500m hp is easier than maxing imo	
[7/14/20 09:02AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Banaan: so it shouldnt be more op	
[7/14/20 09:03AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: that what you think but for me it was easier to max ngl	
[7/14/20 09:03AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: It's just that people usually boss mostly so have better combat	
[7/14/20 09:03AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: exp	
[7/14/20 09:03AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Banaan: i have 75m without trying 	
[7/14/20 09:04AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Banaan: barely did combat in the weekend either	
[7/14/20 09:04AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: yeah weekends are better for skills ngl	
[7/14/20 09:04AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Banaan: i assume primal rapier is the best option	
[7/14/20 09:04AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: yep what I got	
[7/14/20 09:05AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: That and a chaotic cbow	
[7/14/20 09:05AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Banaan: gotta get a dragon defender though	
[7/14/20 09:05AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Banaan: no shield or decent melee armour yet tbh	
[7/14/20 09:05AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: yeah a good shield makes a lot of difference	
[7/14/20 09:06AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: when you start bossing and get a good drop, i'd sell it for divine	
[7/14/20 09:06AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Banaan: i feel like prices are scuffed in this game though	
[7/14/20 09:06AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: Lowkey makes bossing even easier	
[7/14/20 09:06AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: It does feel like that at first but the first drop you get	
[7/14/20 09:07AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: you go from rags to riches

[7/16/20 10:23PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Host:  how do i know the 20% droprate works	
[7/16/20 10:23PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Host: cuz alot of servers just put the number and say its there	
[7/16/20 10:23PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: lmao with rng you really can't tell	
[7/16/20 10:23PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: lol now you got me scared	
[7/16/20 10:23PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Host:  lmaoo	
[7/16/20 10:24PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: u can have 100% dr and still go 3x over the drop table	
[7/16/20 10:24PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: frrr	
[7/16/20 10:24PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: facts	
[7/16/20 10:24PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Host:  ofc	
[7/16/20 10:24PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Blue: :(	
[7/16/20 10:24PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Host:  but ther should be a diff	
[7/16/20 10:24PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Host:  as u got 20% extra drop rate	
[7/16/20 10:24PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: do you know what that 20% stands for tho?	
[7/16/20 10:24PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: its not that the item is 20% more common to you	
[7/16/20 10:25PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: with 20% you have a 20% chance to gain a second roll for the same item	
[7/16/20 10:25PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: the same item*	
[7/16/20 10:25PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: like 1 roll at a 1/200 (lets say) is default	
[7/16/20 10:25PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: oh fr I didn't know that 	
[7/16/20 10:25PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: and ur 20% dr gives u the 20% chance to roll for the 2nd time	
[7/16/20 10:25PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Host:  makes no sense	
[7/16/20 10:25PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Host:  than its a 2e drop chance	
[7/16/20 10:25PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Host:  not drop rate	
[7/16/20 10:25PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Host:  drop rate 	
[7/16/20 10:25PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Host:  say default is 1/100	
[7/16/20 10:26PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Host:  than with 20% should be 1/80	
[7/16/20 10:26PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: that's what I thought	
[7/16/20 10:26PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: no matter how high ur dr is the item is still 1/100	
[7/16/20 10:26PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: but lets say u got 200% dr, u get 3 rolls at that 1/100 every kill	
[7/16/20 10:26PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: kill* so it pretty much makes it 3x easier to get	
[7/16/20 10:26PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: fr dfk you blowing my mind rn	
[7/16/20 10:27PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Host:  makes no sense what ur saying	
[7/16/20 10:27PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: unless flub re-coded the whole rs droprate system, that's	
[7/16/20 10:27PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: how it works	
[7/16/20 10:27PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Host:   i geuss only 1 person can confirm	
[7/16/20 10:27PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Host:  and thats flub	
[7/16/20 10:27PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: lmao where's flub	
[7/16/20 10:27PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Blue: uganda	
[7/16/20 10:27PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: lolol	
[7/16/20 10:27PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Host:  FOR EVER	
[7/16/20 10:27PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: lmao	
[7/16/20 10:27PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: i can give ya an example that would be easier to understand @ hair	
[7/16/20 10:28PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: @ hairloss	
[7/16/20 10:28PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: lets say the item u trying to get is a fury, its a 1/50	
[7/16/20 10:28PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: and rng works like a wheel of fortune in a sense	
[7/16/20 10:28PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: with 100% dr boost, you get a guaranteed extra roll	
[7/16/20 10:28PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Blue: whats rng	
[7/16/20 10:28PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: on that wheel, for a chance to land on 1/50	
[7/16/20 10:28PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: rng = random number generator	
[7/16/20 10:28PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Blue: ahh ty	
[7/16/20 10:29PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: similar to what yters use to draw their giveaways, just a bit better	
[7/16/20 10:29PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: better*, since its always auto-updating with how many ppl are on etc	
[7/16/20 10:29PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: are online etc*	
[7/16/20 10:29PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Host:  we all know yt rigg ther shit 	
[7/16/20 10:29PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: oh snap I think I'm starting to get it	
[7/16/20 10:30PM]	[CLANCHAT]: R0ox:  lol	
[7/16/20 10:30PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: your dr % means your chance at an extra roll	
[7/16/20 10:30PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: 100% is a guaranteed extra roll	
[7/16/20 10:30PM]	[CLANCHAT]: R0ox:  just think its like getting 2nd drop 	
[7/16/20 10:30PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: pretty much yeah ^	
[7/16/20 10:30PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: Dfk how long have you been in the rsps community	
[7/16/20 10:30PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Blue: so we now have a 20% cahnce for an extra roll?	
[7/16/20 10:30PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Host:   i get ur point	
[7/16/20 10:30PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: Don't list names of other rsps	
[7/16/20 10:30PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Host:  but then why call it drop rate	
[7/16/20 10:31PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Host:  call it RNg Rate	
[7/16/20 10:31PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: But you sound hella knowledgeable	
[7/16/20 10:31PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Host:  lol	
[7/16/20 10:31PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: since the 1 moparscape main client where u type in IP	
[7/16/20 10:31PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: For example if an item is 1/1000 normally..	
[7/16/20 10:31PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: to join a specific server	
[7/16/20 10:31PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: Then the 10% boost means you only need 1/900	
[7/16/20 10:31PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: Oh frrr you a veteran 	
[7/16/20 10:31PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Host:  see

[7/16/20 10:32PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: look at it*

[7/16/20 10:39PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: We're not advertising as a custom :P 	
[7/16/20 10:39PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: Noobs own decides his own titles	
[7/16/20 10:39PM]	[CLANCHAT]: R0ox:  well smith is custom

[7/16/20 10:40PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: But we're not a custom in the regular sense	
[7/16/20 10:40PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: Yeah we don't pick the titles :P

[7/16/20 10:41PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: But I do the rest with their support for tedious tasks too	
[7/16/20 10:41PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: would be enough to live up to the 'custom' title	
[7/16/20 10:41PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: Lol 	
[7/16/20 10:41PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: You trolling me rn ;)	
[7/16/20 10:42PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: not tryin to offend you or anything, just giving my opinion	
[7/16/20 10:42PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: You one of these guys who wants an AK47 or something ;)	
[7/16/20 10:42PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: as a guy who's been playing rsps's for around 12-13 years lol	
[7/16/20 10:42PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: We're not marketing as a custom server,	
[7/16/20 10:42PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: adding custom items like that requires a combat system rework imo	
[7/16/20 10:43PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: rework* which is a pain in the ass to do tbh	
[7/16/20 10:43PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: We don't want any custom items - we won't be adding them	
[7/16/20 10:43PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: We have custom skilling methods / Systems e.g. AFK zone	
[7/16/20 10:43PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: But we're not a custom	
[7/16/20 10:44PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: I don't want an AK47 or batman npc	
[7/16/20 10:44PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: :D	
[7/16/20 10:44PM]	[CLANCHAT]: R0ox:  most i see this serv haveing is comebining rs3 and osrs	
[7/16/20 10:44PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: Yes that's right - we're mixed revision but with 317 design	
[7/16/20 10:44PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Big Jugs: goood luck getting rs3 stuff in a 317	
[7/16/20 10:44PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: there's rs3 items too? or just eoc?	
[7/16/20 10:45PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: Haha we don't have RS3 Items, max we have is 600ish	
[7/16/20 10:45PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: adding rs3 stuff to a 317 revision isnt all that hard	
[7/16/20 10:45PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: ofc the graphical models wont be as good as on rs3 itself	
[7/16/20 10:45PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: It's not something I'm interested in :P	
[7/16/20 10:45PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: Yeah they'd be a little glitched	
[7/16/20 10:46PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Big Jugs:  it dosnt even work you would need to remake them from scratch 	
[7/16/20 10:46PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: Yeah I think they changed to a completely different model type	
[7/16/20 10:47PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Dfk Boy: gz	
[7/16/20 10:47PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: I don't want RS3 items, I'll just be adding OSRS items

[7/24/20 12:19PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: Oh my bad sorry bros	
[7/24/20 12:19PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Jackal Max: i never understand how drop increases work	
[7/24/20 12:19PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Doombow420: did you get a promotion hair	
[7/24/20 12:20PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Hairloss: Perhaps	
[7/24/20 12:20PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Jackal Max: when you have a 20% increase	
[7/24/20 12:20PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Jackal Max: and a drop is 1/10	
[7/24/20 12:20PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Jackal Max: is the chance now 1.2/10	
[7/24/20 12:20PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Jackal Max: or 1/8	
[7/24/20 12:20PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Metasploit: 1/1000 drop becomes 1/800	
[7/24/20 12:21PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Jackal Max: technically thats a 25% increase then	
[7/24/20 12:21PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Host:  anyone down to gamble ?	
[7/24/20 12:21PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Doombow420: 25 would be 1/750	
[7/24/20 12:21PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Metasploit: 20% of 100 is 20	
[7/24/20 12:21PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Metasploit: 20% of 1000 is 200	
[7/24/20 12:21PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Jackal Max: no yeah, by that reasoning obviously	
[7/24/20 12:22PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Jackal Max: but 1/1000 = 0.001 and 1/800 = 0.00125	
[7/24/20 12:22PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Jackal Max: and the increase in those odds is 25%	
[7/24/20 12:22PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Doombow420: wtf are you talking about...	
[7/24/20 12:22PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Metasploit: I see where you're coming from	
[7/24/20 12:22PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Metasploit: drops aren't coded like that here	
[7/24/20 12:22PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Jackal Max: yeah thats what i was wondering	
[7/24/20 12:22PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Jackal Max: thanks!

[7/24/20 12:23PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: the dr boosts mean that we reduce the highest 1/950 	
[7/24/20 12:24PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Martijn: sup loki	
[7/24/20 12:24PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: to only require 1/760	
[7/24/20 12:24PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Flub: as an example	
[7/24/20 12:24PM]	[CLANCHAT]: Loky: do we get starter rewards?

[7/30/20 03:02AM]	[CLANCHAT]: Artae: and then with other multipliers like ring of coins 10 percent
